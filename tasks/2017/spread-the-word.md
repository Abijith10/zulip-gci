# GCI Tasks: Spread The Word

## Background

Upvotes and reviews make a big difference in the public perception of projects
like Zulip.

## Task description

In this task, we will ask you to rate and review Zulip on some technology
review sites.

Start by opening up a text file. You will be putting links in this file in
order to demonstrate that you have completed parts of the task. We'll call
this file the submission file.

### Star us on GitHub.

There are four main repositories:
[server/web](https://github.com/zulip/zulip),
[mobile](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-mobile),
[desktop](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-electron), and [Python
API](https://github.com/zulip/python-zulip-api). For each repository, star the
repository, and then record in your submission file the number of stars that
the repository had when you starred it.

### Share Zulip on StackShare

1. Create an account at StackShare. Add your name and a picture, (i.e. do the
work to have a real profile).

2. Think of at least six technology tools or products you really like, and
consider adding Zulip to that list.

3. For each product in 2: Add the product to your Stack, star it, and
add or upvote at least three reasons why people like the product that
you find compelling.

4. Add a link to your profile to your submission file. The link should look like
https://stackshare.io/Lyla-Fischer, but replace Lyla-Fischer with your
username.

### Write a review on the Google Play Store or iOS app store

Zulip's React Native mobile app is new and doesn't have a lot of
reviews yet.  The total number of reviews, and in particular five star
reviews, make a big difference in how a product is perceived.

1. Rate and review Zulip in the Google Play Store or iOS app store.

2. Add a description of which review is yours in the app store, to make it
easy for us to verify (e.g. copy the text of the review into your submission
file).

### Share Zulip on alternativeto.net

1. Get your parent's permission to make an account, and fill out your profile.
Link to at least one external social media account.

2. Think of 2-4 products you use, and upvote ("Like") them. To get to a product,
search for it in the "I want to replace" bar in the upper right.

3. For each product *P* from step 2, think of 1-2 competitors of *P*, go to
those competitors pages, and list *P* as a good alternative to that
competitor. Zulip is considered by many to be a good alternative to Slack,
Mattermost, and Hipchat.

3. Add a link to your profile to your submission file. Your profile link
should look like https://alternativeto.net/user/aviendha1591/, but replace
aviendha1591 with your username.

### Consider following the Zulip project

This isn't required to complete the task, but while you're at it,
we recommend [following Zulip on Twitter](https://twitter.com/zulip)
so you can get intersting Zulip community news.

### Submit your submission file

When you finish the task, save your submission file as a PDF and submit it to
us in the GCI app.
