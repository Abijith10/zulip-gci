# Get Comfortable With Git

This task will familiarize you with `git`, which is the version control system
all GitHub projects, including Zulip, use.

## Prerequisites

* A working `git` installation. See [these instructions](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

* A suitable terminal. This is the built-in terminal client on Linux and OS X,
 and Git Bash on Windows (assuming you installed Git On Windows).

* Consider
  [installing a graphical Git repository viewer](http://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/git/setup.html#get-a-graphical-client).
  These can be really helpful to see the exact state of your local
  repository when practicing with Git, branching, and rebasing, and
  how that state is changed by each Git command.

## Task

* Read the GitHub [Hello World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) tutorial and follow
  the steps. Take a **screenshot** of a successfully merged pull request in your
  `hello-world` repository.

* Work through the [Try Git](https://try.github.io/) tutorial. Take a
  **screenshot** of the final page with your badge.

* Complete some of the [Learn Git Branching](http://learnGegitbranching.js.org/)
  exercises. We would recommend completing at least the first 8. Take a
  **screenshot** of the `levels` selection screen.

* Get used to the idea of
  [rebasing](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Changing-Multiple-Commit-Messages).
  Zulip uses a rebase-oriented workflow.

* Check out the
  [Zulip Git Guide](http://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/git/overview.html)
  and skim each of the sub-articles, so you know what's in there.
  This guide has a lot of helpful information, guides, and techniques
  that you'll want to be able to call on in the future.

* If you're curious to learn more about how `git` works, watch
  [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2Msq90ZknI)!  Reading
  [our guide on how Git works](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/git/the-git-difference.html)
  and the articles linked from there is a great way to get deeper into
  learning Git.

## Submission

Submit the three screenshots in the GCI app and provide a link to your
`hello-world` repository.

## Completion criteria

Mentors will check that the student uploaded 3 screenshots for:
- a merged pull request in their `hello-world` repository
- a final page of the Try Git tutorial with their badge
- a screenshot of the `levels` selection screen for Learn Git Branching
  exercises, with at least the first 8 exercises marked as completed

The submission should also include a link to the student's `hello-world`
repository on GitHub.
