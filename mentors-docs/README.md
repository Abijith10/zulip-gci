Zulip is participating in Google Code-in (GCI), an awesome program
where high school students compete to contribute the most to major
open source projects like Zulip and Wikimedia. There is a lot of work
to be done for it, and we could use as much help as we can get.

Volunteers involved with the various open source projects
participating in GCI are called "mentors".  The term "mentor" usually
suggests a 1:1 relationship with a mentee (and that is how GCI's
sister program, Google Summer of Code, works).  GCI is structured
around each student doing dozens of smaller individual tasks, so each
mentor will likely help dozens of students over the course of the
program.

The main that GCI mentors do is to help our high school student
contributors get involved in Zulip.  This includes answering
questions, teaching skills, and reviewing student submissions.  See
[How to mentor](how-to-mentor.md) for details on what the hour-to-hour
is like.

If you are willing to volunteer your time to help with generic prep
work, check out the
[issues in this repository](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-gci/issues).
One of the major categories of prep work is
[creating tasks](making-tasks.md), which continues throughout the GCI
program (at least, in 2016, students completed over 700 tasks, so we
needed to keep making more throughout the program).

## Become a Mentor

If you’re new to our community, please do a small contribution (see
https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/readme-symlink.html for how to do this)
so you know our processes.

Additionally, we recommend asking a more experienced contributor to
give you feedback when you think a task or PR is complete, to make
sure you are applying
[the Zulip standards](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing/index.html)
correctly.

If you’re an existing member of our community, you’re welcome to
mentor!  Ping one of the admins (Lyla, Rishi, Vishnu) to get all of
the appropriate accesses.
