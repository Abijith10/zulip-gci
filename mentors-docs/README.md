Zulip is participating in Google Code-in, an awesome program where high school
students compete to contribute the most to major open source projects like
Zulip and Wikimedia. There is a lot of work to be done for it, and we could
use as much help as we can get.

The main thing that we ask mentors to do is to directly help our high
school student contributors get involved in Zulip. 
[How to mentor](how-to-mentor.md).

If you are willing to volunteer your time to help with generic prep work, check
out the [issues in this repository](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-gci/issues).
One of the major categories of prep work is [creating tasks](making-tasks.md).
